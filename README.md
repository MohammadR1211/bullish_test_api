Initial Setup
====================
Below section gives insights on assumptions and decision I have made for this test project.

- cucumber is used to incorporate BDD


# Steps to run tests
- To install node modules run `npm i`
- To run tests run `npm run test`
- To generate test report run `npm run report`

# Note
As these are not unit tests, and I don't have access to codebase, I can't generate coverage for code the against which tests are running.
